# MMA860-Coke-Volume-Revenue-Forecast

The MMA 860 (Acquisition and Management of Data) course focused on the steps leading up to, and including, building our first predictive model using the R programming language. During the course, we learned a series of techniques for screening data and managing data deficiencies as precursors to actual analysis. These included techniques for data manipulation, data wrangling, feature engineering, and managing data issues prevalent in predictive modelling.

This project was intended to allow us to put into practice some of the techniques from class on real world data and to explain those results to a managerial audience. Our team was be asked to obtain a dataset and propose a collection of analysis and data management techniques to apply to that data. We then needed to create a report of the results of our analysis usign tools like PowerPoint or Tableau.

The business case we decided to use was the following:

### Executive Summary: 

The Commercial team at Coca Cola has asked the analytics team to create a model that will help predict the expected volume and revenue performance in 2022 based on the most recent promotional calendar created by the Sales teams. The forecasting team only has three employees and cannot create an accurate forecast quickly and efficiently. We recommend leveraging our historical Point of Sale data to build a model to predict volume and revenue performance based on the calendar provided by Sales. We have three years of data (pre-covid 2017 to 2019), categorized by week, year, client, product, holidays, promotion type, unit sales, and price. The Commercial team would also like to have the data presented using a visualization tool such as Tableau for presentations and to give the executive team the ability to dissect the data and get granular if they need to. 

The course concepts we will utilize in this project include:
- Visualizing data for insight generation
- Feature Engineering
- Predictive modeling
- Managing problems with error terms
- Tableau Dashboarding
